# isg-open-day-poster
Beamer poster theme for use at the [Royal Holloway Information Security Group](isg.rhul.ac.uk) open day

I would not be surprised if this poster theme has a few bugs in it.  If you find one then please let me know via GitHub or [email](mailto:robert.lee.2013@live.rhul.ac.uk).

Also, I would like to emphasise that this poster theme is not finished yet.  The poster theme is supposed to include a logo for the ISG open day, however I haven't got that yet and so it has not been included at this time.  It will be added to the style as soon as I have got it so please be sure to update your LaTeX files for the poster theme before you submit your poster for printing.
